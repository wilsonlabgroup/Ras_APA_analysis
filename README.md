# Alternative polyadenylation site (APA) analysis for celegans

This repo contains essential processed data and scripts to reproduce analysis and figures in manuscript: **Alternative polyadenylation is a determinant of oncogenic Ras function** (Subramanian et al. 2021).

- **PA_sites_identification.html**: code for identifying polyadenylation (PA) sites from 3'UTR-seq data in celegans
- **differential_PA.html**: code for performing differential PA site usage between conditions of interest and for reproducing all figures (for celegans data) in manuscript. 
- **derfinder_ce11_utr_functions.r**: customized functions used in the analysis
- **gdata**: folder contains celegans genomic annotations used 
- **mapped_bigwig**: contains bigwig files of aligned reads, used for PA site identification 

RData and RDS files are included for convenience of reproducing figures.
